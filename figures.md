    <title>Efsevin restores rhythmic cardiac contractions in zebrafish tremblor embryos.</title>
    <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Line scans across the atria of <italic>Tg(myl7:GFP)</italic> embryonic hearts at 48 hpf. Rhythmically 
    alternating systoles and diastoles are recorded from vehicle- (upper left) or efsevin- treated wild type (upper right) and 
    efsevin-treated <italic>tre</italic> (lower right) embryos, while only sporadic unsynchronized contractions are recorded 
    from vehicle-treated <italic>tre</italic> embryos (lower left). (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>) Fractional shortening (FS) 
    deduced from the line-scan traces. While cardiac contraction was not observed in <italic>tre</italic>, efsevin-treated wild 
    type and <italic>tre</italic> hearts have similar levels of FS to those observed in control hearts. Ventricular FS of wild 
    type v.s. wild type &#x2b; efsevin vs tre &#x2b; efsevin: 39 &#xb1; 0.6%, n &#x3d; 8 vs 39 &#xb1; 1%, n &#x3d; 10 vs 35 
    &#xb1; 3%, n &#x3d; 6; and Atrial FS: 37 &#xb1; 1%, n &#x3d; 11 vs 35 &#xb1; 2%, n &#x3d; 11 vs 33 &#xb1; 2%, n &#x3d; 15. 
    (<bold>D</bold>) While efsevin restored a heart rate of 46 &#xb1; 2 beats per minute (bpm) in <italic>tre</italic> embryos, 
    same treatment does not affect the heart rate in wild type embryos (126 &#xb1; 2 bpm in vehicle-treated embryos vs 123 &#xb1;
    3 bpm in efsevin-treated wild-type embryos). &#x2a;&#x2a;&#x2a;, p &#x3c; 0.001 by one-way ANOVA. (<bold>E</bold>) Dose-
    dependence curve for efsevin. The <italic>tre</italic> embryos were treated with various concentrations of efsevin from 24 
    hpf and cardiac contractions were analyzed at 48 hpf. (<bold>F</bold>&#x2013;<bold>H</bold>) Representative time traces of 
    local field potentials for wild type (<bold>F</bold>), <italic>tre</italic> (<bold>G</bold>) and efsevin-treated 
    <italic>tre</italic> (<bold>H</bold>) embryos clearly display periods of regular, irregular, and restored periodic 
    electrical activity. (<bold>I</bold>) In vivo optical maps of Ca<sup>2&#x2b;</sup> activation represented by isochronal 
    lines every 33 ms recorded from 36 hpf wild type (left), <italic>tre</italic> (center) and efsevin-treated 
    <italic>tre</italic> (right) embryos.</p>

      <title>Knocking down RFRP during stress completely prevents stress-induced reproductive dysfunction.</title>
      <p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental time line. (<bold>B</bold>) Corticosterone concentrations were measured in serum samples
      from tail vein blood immediately before and after stress sessions on days 1, 11, and 18. (<bold>C</bold>) Total reproductive
      success was measured as percentage of females that successfully brought a litter to full term (Scramble/control N &#x3d; 17, 
      Scramble/Stress N &#x3d; 14, shRNA/control N &#x3d; 20, shRNA/stress N &#x3d; 14, g-statistics: G &#x3d; 5.836, df &#x3d; 1 p 
      &#x3d; 0.016, fisher's exact test p &#x3d; 0.0031). Breaking down total reproductive success, (<bold>D</bold>) copulation
      success was measured as percentage of females that exhibited lordosis and allowed a male to achieve intromission within 
      15 min (g-statistics: G &#x3d; 2.405, df &#x3d; 1 p &#x3d; 0.028, fisher's exact test p &#x3d; 0.0062), and (<bold>E</bold>) 
      pregnancy success refers to the percentage of females that got pregnant out of the subgroup that successfully copulated 
      (Scramble/control N &#x3d; 15, Scramble/Stress N &#x3d; 6, RFRP-shRNA/control N &#x3d; 18, RFRP-shRNA/stress N &#x3d; 11). 
      (<bold>F</bold>) Litter sizes measured as number of pups born alive immediately after birth (dams-Scramble/control N &#x3d; 13, 
      Scramble/Stress N &#x3d; 3, RFRP-shRNA/control N &#x3d; 16, RFRP-shRNA/stress N &#x3d; 9). (<bold>G</bold>) Embryos implanted 
      measured as number of placental scars identified in the dam's uterine horns after birth. (<bold>H</bold>) Embryo survival was 
      calculated as the number of birthed pups divided by number of maternal placental scars and shown as a percentage (indicative 
      of initial implantation, mean &#xb1; SEM) &#x2a;p &#x3c; 0.05, &#x2a;&#x2a;p &#x3c; 0.01, &#x2a;&#x2a;&#x2a;p &#x3c; 0.001. 
      Reproductive success statistics were done by G-statistics tests followed by Fisher's Exact test, statistics for litter size,
      placental scars, and embryo resorption were done by a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests
      and CORT statistics analyzed by a repeated two-way ANOVA.</p>

     <title>RFRP-shRNA animals had increased plasma estradiol on proestrus during stress and RFRP-shRNA animals that mated had higher 
      circulating estradiol than scrambled animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Estradiol levels as measured from tail bleed samples 
      over the cycles of all stressed rats with either scrambled or RFRP-shRNA virus (n &#x3d; 14). (<bold>B</bold>) Within proestrus,
      estradiol measurements were separated by mating success and virus (n &#x3d; 10, 21, 11, 25 samples for each successive group). 
      (<bold>C</bold>) Lordosis intensity, or quality of the lordosis pose, scored between 0 and 3 as published in 
      <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hardy and Debold (1971)</xref>. We found a significant main effect of stress (F(1, 61) &#x3d; 
      5.15, p &#x3d; 0.0268), however, no significant differences within groups. (<bold>D</bold>) Lordosis quotient was calculated as 
      the ratio of male mounts to female lordosis poses of a score of 2 or 3. We found a significant main effect of stress (F(1, 61) 
      &#x3d; 11.66, p &#x3d; 0.0011), as well a significant decrease in the scramble stress group. p &#x3c; 0.05, &#x2a;&#x2a;p &#x3c;
      0.01, &#x2a;&#x2a;&#x2a;p &#x3c; 0.001. Estradiol, lordosis intensity and quotient statistics were a two-way analysis of variance
      (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests.</p>
